AdHocSim is the outcome of my Bachelor's thesis that I completed in 2003.

AdHocSim models an ad-hoc wireless network of a many independent nodes
moving in a empty space and is based on OMNeT++ v. 3.0.

The project includes:
- 	a physical layer model for each host in charge of dynamically enable
	unidirectional or bi-directional communication links. The links are created 
	in a independent way in function of the location,
	transmission power and the sensitivity of the antenna of each host;

- 	a simple MAC layer model in charge of discarding received packets that are
	not addressed to the specific host;

-	a routing layer that implements two alternative protocols:
  	+ AODV standard draft v.10;
  	+ DSV ;

- 	a set of host-mobility algorithms, in particular:
	+ random walk,
	+ restricted random walk,
	+ random direction, 
	+ random waypoint, 
	+ pursuit model, 
	+ normal markovian mobility model;

-	an application layer in charge of generating random traffic following
	an exponential distribution.
